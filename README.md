## 1. Introduction

One day :cityscape: , a dog named  BAILEY :poodle: was caught in a factory:factory: and packed into a magical cardboard box:package: . It is pretty difficult for him to escape from the box, so he decides to use the magic of this box to run this strange factory.

**Magic of the box: **

1. **Jump in the air**: Allow BAILEY to jump in the air. After air jump, the box will **raise by half a meter**.

2. **Clean !!**: Clear all obstacles in the next five seconds.

   **Note:** This magic box hasn't solved gravity yet so the package will **fall freely** under the force of gravity.
